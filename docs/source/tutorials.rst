Tutorials
=========

These tutorials are replicated in jupyter notebook form and contained within examples. All of these examples can be found in `examples/notebooks <https://github.com/symmy596/PolyPy/tree/master/examples/notebooks>`_.

All tutorials use fluorite :math:`CeO_2` grain boundary as an example. Due to the large size of DL_POLY and DL_MONTE trajectory files, the tutorial notebooks contained within the git repository use a very short :math:`CaF_2` trajectory.
